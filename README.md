## Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Identifying design properties (such as colors, typography, and spacing) from a mockup is essential because:

- It ensures visual consistency across the entire application, providing users with a polished and professional experience.
- It helps in building reusable components that adhere to the design system.
- It allows the team to implement the design accurately, reducing miscommunication between designers and developers.
- It contributes to maintaining brand identity and enhances user trust in the platform.
- It speeds up development by giving developers a clear reference for UI decisions.
  
By documenting these properties early, teams can build more efficiently and ensure the final product aligns closely with the original design vision.
