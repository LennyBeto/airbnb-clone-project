# Project Overview

This project provides learners with the opportunity to grasp complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while developing a scalable web application. It aims to elevate my skills in modern software development by mastering collaborative workflows with GitHub, deepening my knowledge of backend architecture and database design, implementing advanced API security measures, and gaining proficiency in CI/CD pipeline management. Additionally, it will enhance my ability to document complex projects and integrate technologies such as Django, MySQL, and GraphQL into a cohesive ecosystem.

## Team Roles
